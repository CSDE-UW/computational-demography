      <title>Connor Gilroy - Workshop on word embeddings for the social sciences</title>
      <link>/computational-demography/post/2021-01-11-nih-marcum/</link>

      <description>Abstract Word embeddings are a relatively new tool for computational text analysis. This workshop will explain what word embeddings are and give examples of how they have been used in cultural sociology and political science. I&amp;rsquo;ll then demonstrate some of these uses of word embeddings, including methods for word similarity, semantic change over time, document conceptual engagement, and binary concept construction. This hands-on tutorial will draw on in-progress dissertation work examining discourse about &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; in English.</description>
