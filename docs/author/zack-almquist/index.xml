      <description>Brown Bag with Neal Marquez, Sociology - Rise in mobile phone GPS technologies has led to an increase in the production of granular digital-trace data. Previous studies have utilized digital trace data in demographic contexts where other sources are lacking or have often calibrated estimates to traditional data sources. Traditional data sources, however, may be biased, especially for historically data-marginalized populations. In our study we examine how traditional data on commuting, such as LODES, may miss commuting patterns of data-marginalized populations and how digital-trace data from SafeGraph may be used to supplement our understanding of these groups.</description>

      <description>The graphical user interface (GUI) revolutionized geographic information systems (GIS), allowing users to perform substantially more work with far less training than when GIS was completely command-driven. Despite the user-friendliness of GUI-driven GIS applications, there are many instances when GIS functionality is more appropriately code-based, in particular for the purposes of documentation and reproducibility. For many GIS tasks, things have come full circle, from code to GUI and back to code.</description>

      <description>Paul Chung is a Research Scientist at Facebook on the Demography and Survey Science (DSS) Team. His current work involves applying formal demographic and statistical methodology to solve complex online population estimation problems. Prior to Facebook, he consulted for a number of Bay Area &amp;ldquo;civic tech&amp;rdquo; organizations (e.g. Code for America), where he helped carry out research to identify and size new opportunities for improving public access to government programs. Formerly, Paul received his PhD in Sociology and Demography at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied the link between race differences in mortality, kinship, and incarceration over the life course using a novel combination of lifetable and microsimulation techniques.</description>
