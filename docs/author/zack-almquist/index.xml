      <description>Abstract Medical doctors and nurses are one of the most important resources for vaccine information for the American public. When deciding whether or not to get vaccinated people look to medical professionals; they discuss care decisions with medical providers and they look to the opinions that medical professionals post online. The widespread use of social media for information sharing and seeking, offers the average doctor and nurse a public platform on which to share their views on vaccination directly with thousands of individuals across the globe.</description>
