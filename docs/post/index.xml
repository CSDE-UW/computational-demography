      <description>On March 7, 2019, Ian Kennedy, a graduate student from Sociology, led a tutorial and discussion about analyzing text data for demographic research.
Based on his research projects using data from Craigslist and Twitter, he presented on applications of keyword matching, n-gram regression, topic modeling, and word embeddings.
The RMarkdown and Jupyter notebooks for his tutorial can be found on GitHub at the following repository:

      <description>Why make a website? Academic researchers need to communicate their work!
Several kinds of websites can be useful for this:
 a personal academic homepage a page for a specific research project a website for a course a website for a working group or seminar (like CDWG!)  Key ideas You can make a website without knowing much or any html/css; there are tools that let you do a lot in plain text and R instead.</description>

      <description>On December 6, 2018, CDWG held a roundtable on using Facebook advertising platform data for demographic research. Three UW graduate students with active projects using Facebook ads data led the conversation:
Lee Fiorio (geography) investigates the possibility of combining traditional data on migrants with estimates of migrants from Facebook Ads to produce more detailed cross-tabulations than available from traditional data sources. Using data from Facebook Ads as the seed, he uses Iterative Proportional Fitting to estimate a three-dimensional cross tabulation (migrant stocks by age by sex) from UN-published migrant data.</description>
