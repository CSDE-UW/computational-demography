*Abstract* Word embeddings are a relatively new tool for computational text analysis. This workshop will explain what word embeddings are and give examples of how they have been used in cultural sociology and political science. I'll then demonstrate some of these uses of word embeddings, including methods for word similarity, semantic change over time, document conceptual engagement, and binary concept construction. This hands-on tutorial will draw on in-progress dissertation work examining discourse about "community" in English. The tutorial will lead into an open discussion about future potential applications of embeddings in the social sciences, including demography.

The hands-on component will likely be in Python, though R alternatives will be discussed. Materials will be shared online beforehand.
