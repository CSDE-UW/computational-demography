Emanuela Furfaro presented her work on accounting for immigration policies in the analysis of migration networks.

Here's the abstract for Emanuela's presentation:

_In this work, we apply statistical network models to study the effects of macro factors on determining international migration flows from developing countries to a group of selected Western European countries. Besides the traditional pull and push effects, gravity-related variables and cultural similarities, we investigate the role of immigration policies in explaining the network structure. During the presentation I will also give the details on the data harmonization and the computational challenges encountered during the data preparation._



Emanuela Furfaro is a is a postdoctoral fellow visiting from Milan for two months.  While she is here, she is working with Adrian Raftery on Bayesian estimation techniques.  She is also studying internal migration and migration networks.
