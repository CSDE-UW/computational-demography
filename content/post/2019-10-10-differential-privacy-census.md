Lee Fiorio (Geography) presented joint work with Neal Marquez (Sociology) on the implications of differential privacy in the 2020 US Census for policy and social science research:

> In an attempt to better safeguard the information that Census Bureau collects from the public, the Bureau has committed to deploy a variation of differential privacy on the 2020 Census and all census products moving forward. This noise injection process has the potential to better protect the private information of individuals, however, the cost to accuracy of statistical measures is not well understood. In this talk we present the proposed methods outlined by the Census Bureau for noise injection, how it could improve data security, and the potential consequences to researchers and policy makers. We will then present the foundation of our own concerns for spatial analysis with a noise injected census product and open up the conversation to the group to talk about the cost/benefit trade-offs of this new process.

A lively discussion ensued about the community-level implications of the proposed changes to guarantee individual privacy.
