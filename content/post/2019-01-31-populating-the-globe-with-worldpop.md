This week's meeting of the CSDE-CWG was led by [Nathan Welch](http://www.nathangwelch.com/) from the Department of Statistics here at the University of Washington. Nathan walked us through his experience attending the Inaugural WorldPop Winter School, a brief course that looks to introduce students, government workers, and NGO employees on the resources the resources produced by World Pop.

## The Agenda of World Pop  
As stated on the [Word Pop website](https://www.worldpop.org/) the goal of the World Pop organization are to "Meet the needs of [contemporary data on human population distributions] through the provision of detailed and open-access population distribution dataset built using transparent approaches." What this entails is the creation of exteremly high resolution maps, often at the 100m x 100m scale, of population estimates broken down by age, sex, and other demographic indicators often of interest to reserachers. The level of detail that these maps give us is extraordinary and because the information is comprehensive of the globe any administrative unit that you could want to know the population of is calculated simply by aggregating the information across each of the 100m x 100m units with a given adminstrative boundary. In addition, these geographic distributions are estimated annualy allowing not only for analysis in changes of magnitudes of populations, but also, shifts in the spatial distributions of populations as well.

The utility of these measures are many, and the World Pop organization is also focused on building a database of measures related to population health that is based on their population distribution measures. For example, these population maps have been used to estimate the distance required to travel for a women to access to maternal care. Another strand of research combines popualtion metrics with measures of incidence of malria to map out risk of contracting malaria at high spatial resolutions in northern Namibia.  

## How Are the Measures Contructed?  

While these measures are impressive it's helpful to understand how they are constructed in order to understand their limitations and which contexts would be most appropriate for using these measures.
